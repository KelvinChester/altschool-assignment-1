    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Aguonovo Kenechukwu Kelvin. I am a multi-disciplinary creative
      and aspiring tech professional from Nigeria with a degree in Electronics
      Engineering from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Over the years, I have
      developed a wide range of skills across various fields including graphic
      design, videography, photography, video editing, fashion design, and
      full-stack web development. My journey into the world of technology and
      creativity started with a simple desire to express ideas visually and
      solve everyday problems. While studying engineering, I immersed myself in
      creative work—designing posters, producing videos, and managing media
      content for churches and small organizations. <br />
      <br />I played key roles in the media teams at Christ Church Chapel UNN
      and Wesley Cathedral Methodist Church Enugu (Wesley Inspiration TV), where
      I contributed to video production, livestreaming, and content management.
      In the course of my journey, I’ve also taken on freelance work, entered
      graphic design challenges, built YouTube channels, and managed social
      media content across various platforms. <br />
      <br />I enjoy storytelling through visual media and have used these skills
      in real-world settings. My engineering background also came into play when
      I built an IoT-based smart power monitoring system as my final year
      project, combining hardware and software to provide intelligent energy
      tracking—this experience deepened my interest in backend systems. Although
      I haven’t yet served in the NYSC or completed my school clearance, I’ve
      remained committed to self-development despite limited access to resources
      like a personal laptop. I’ve taken courses in backend development through
      platforms like ALX and Axia Africa, and I previously interned at Digital
      Dreams Tech Academy to learn full-stack web development. <br />
      <br />Mylong-term vision includes launching two major initiatives: Pishon
      Creative Academy, a platform that provides tech and creative education
      while also linking clients with skilled creatives, and TailorTech Africa,
      a business that merges tailoring with technology to offer smart, automated
      fitting and customization services. Both ideas reflect my passion for
      innovation, problem-solving, and entrepreneurship. <br />
      <br />
      I believe that creativity and technology are powerful tools for change. I
      see myself as someone called to build solutions, empower others, and leave
      a lasting impact—especially in Africa. Joining the School of Engineering
      at AltSchool Africa is one of the many steps I’m taking to sharpen my
      technical skills and become a world-class backend engineer.

    <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool Africa</h2>
    <p>
      I joined AltSchool Africa to gain a structured and immersive learning
      experience in Backend Engineering. My goal is to fill the knowledge gaps I
      have from self-learning and become confident in building reliable,
      scalable backend systems. AltSchool offers not just learning, but
      community and mentorship, which I find very valuable.
